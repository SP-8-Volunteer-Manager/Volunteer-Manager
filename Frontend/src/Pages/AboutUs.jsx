                        Homeward Bound Pet Rescue is a 501(c)(3), non-profit organization located in in Gilmer County, Georgia.

                        <br /><br />                       
                        Homeward Bound was established in August 2000 when two caring woman began taking in stray dogs. 
                        They fostered and vetted them before adopting them out into loving homes. The need in the community was overwhelming. 
                        This realization prompted them to open a bank account with a $500 deposit. 
                        They were subsequently granted 501(C)(3) tax exempt status and thus it was that Homeward Bound was born.
                        Finally in 2006, Homeward Bound received a building and 2.88 acres of land upon which our current shelter sits. 
                        The building, formerly the old Gilmer-Fannin Humane Society facility, was built around 1985 and stood vacant for years. 
                        It had no heat, air conditioning or fencing and the grass was as tall as the building itself. 
                        But the potential was there, and this became the new home base for Homeward Bound Pet Rescue.
                        In April 2012, Homeward Bound was on the verge of closing its doors, not for lack of funds but personnel. 
                        In order to save Homeward Bound, a community meeting was held in Ellijay Georgia to try and stimulate community interest 
                        and increase the organization's volunteer base. 
                        The community response was both immediate and positive and efforts were focused 
                        on rebuilding the Board of Directors and filling those volunteer positions that 
                        are so essential to quality care and the continuance of our mission. The revival 
                        of community participation and the effort put forth by the volunteers kept the doors of Homeward Bound open.
                        <br /><br />
                        The changes are visible not only in the appearance of the shelter, 
                        but in the outpouring of ideas and support from our volunteers and from our community. 
                        Since August of 2000, Homeward Bound has rescued and placed into forever homes over 7,000 animals. 
                        An awesome statistic for an awesome organization!
